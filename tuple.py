#tuple is like list only, but like list it is not changeable, once a tuple is defined it cannot be edited

marks=(94,65,25,75,75)
# the following is by default a tuple
marks="ram","shyam","abhi","siha"

print(marks.count(75))
print(marks.index(94))


# set is defined by {}
# tuple is defined by ()
# list is defined by []
